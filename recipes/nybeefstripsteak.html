    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>3 New YorK strip steaks, about 1 1/4-inch thick</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon your favorite seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>

      </li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>

        <p>
          About 30 minutes before cooking, remove the steaks from the
          refrigerator and allow them to come to room temperature. Pat steaks
          dry with paper towels, and sprinkle seasoning salt and Montreal Steak
          Seasoning on both sides.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="directions" id="steps">
        <p>
          Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), according to
          manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="directions" id="steps">
        <p>
          When the air fryer is fully preheated, spray both sides of steaks with
          olive oil cooking spray.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="directions" id="steps">
        <p>
          Place steaks in the air fryer and cook about 10 minutes for medium
          rare, turning halfway through.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="directions" id="steps">
        <p>
          Check the temperature of the meat before removing from the air fryer.
          For medium-rare, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
          should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Tent with foil, about 10
          minutes. Serve warm.
